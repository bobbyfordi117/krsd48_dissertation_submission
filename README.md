Fresh repo to host project code ready for submission.

My original git repo broke due to the massive amounts of sound files that were being tracked. When I tried to git push, it would not work. Thus, I have made a fresh repo and will include the data sound files zipped to ensure I don't max out the upload size. In the actualy project said files were unzipped so they could be accessed by the machine learning model.
